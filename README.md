# bamazon-node-mySQL

Bamazon app is created to run a back end data-base website relative to "Amazon" where a user can purchase products and the manager can add a new product, restock the inventory, check to see which items have a low inventory to make sure they dont run out. 

The app is useful because it allows  you to update, delete, add and view your database quickly and easily.

The user can get started by typing "node bamazonCustomer.js" and then select the "ID" of the item youd like to purchase and the quantity.

The manager can get started by typing "node bamazonManager.js" and then select between "viewing items", "Adding an item", "Seeing items with low inventory (lower than 5)" and "updating inventory numbers."
